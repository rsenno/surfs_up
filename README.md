# Analysis for a “Surf n’ Shake” Shop in Oahu, Hawaii Proposal
## Overview of the analysis:
### Discussion
-	An SQLite database containing weather data for Oahu, Hawaii over a period from 2010 to 2017 was provided with a request to perform some analysis for a hypothetical “Surf n’ Shake” shop in Oahu, Hawaii.
### Prior Work
-	Initially, an analysis of precipitation was requested for a one-year period starting on August 8th, 2017.
-	In addition, the measurement stations were evaluated for completeness of reporting, and data from the most reliable station was selected to analyze temperature observations. 
### Current Work
-	An additional request was made to provide summary statistics for the months of June and December across the entire dataset. 
## Results
-	June Summary: The mean temperature for June was around 75 degrees Fahrenheit and tended to stay in the 70’s with a peak high of 85 and a minimum low of 64.
-	December Summary: The mean temperature for December was around 71 degrees Fahrenheit and tended to stay in the 70’s with a peak high of 83 and a minimum low of 56.
-	It was noted that there were fewer observations for December; however, there were plenty of datapoints for a reliable analysis. 
## Summary
-	Weather in Oahu, Hawaii appears to be relatively mild throughout the year as far as temperatures are concerned. 
### Possible Further Work
-	In prior work, while the rainfall appeared to be low overall (mean: 0.18 and third quartile: 0.13) but there was the occasional possibility of heavy rains (max: 6.7).  An analysis seeking to determine if there are months or parts of the year where rainfall tends to peak would be helpful for planning.
-	Along the same lines as above, rainfall patterns for June and December could be investigated.
